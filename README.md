# Project Name: Ultrasound Nerve Segmentation

# What are we trying to do?
- Build a model that can identify nerve structures in a dataset of ultrasound images of the neck accurately. Doing so would improve catheter placement and contribute to a more pain free future.  


# TO-DO/Action Items {NIZAM}
- if encountered important issues, highlight them and communicate to Sasha.
-  document everything that you do!!!
- Model Training - 1

# TO-DO/Action Items {SASHA}
- Model Training - 2
- ...

# Result Comparision
- Comparing the results and tweaking Model's performance to increase the accuracy and decrease the error :P

# DONE:
- Preprocess the dataset (remove the images with conflicting masks)
